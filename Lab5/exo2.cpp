1. Vector and (Doubly) Linked List
2.a. Insert first searches the list corresponsiding to the hash of the element, checks if it is in it, and if not it appends it to the LL.
2.b. Delete searches the list corresponsiding to the hash of the element, checks if it is in it, and removes it if found.
3.a. Rehashing is run in order to reduce collisions when the number of elements is equal to the table size.
3.b. Rehashing is done by finding the next prime P greater than 2*CurrentSize, and then inserts all the elements of the current table into the new one.
